# tFAC-sESAV-MBP
This is the Matlab code for the paper "High-order nonuniform time-stepping and MBP-preserving linear schemes for the time-fractional Allen--Cahn equation", by Bingyin Zhang, Hong Wang and Hongfei Fu. Two linear stabilized numerical schemes that can preserve both the discrete energy stability and maximum-bound principle (MBP) are developed for the time-fractional Allenâ€“Cahn equation.
